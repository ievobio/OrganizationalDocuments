# How to make sure April Wright isn't in charge forever

1. Executive leadership structure
	- President: I think we should adopt the Systematic Bio system of having a president elect who learns the ropes from the current president for a year, then is president. Then they serve as past president, a consulting role for a year following their term.
	- Vice president: I think these should be one-year terms. 

	- The president and vice president should work together to set the budget for meetings, and other expenditures. They should also set the year's "theme" for the meeting. Communications to the Evolution Meetings organization should come through these two people.

2. Organizing committee
	- This should be a "whoever wants to help" thing
	- Organizing council: These folks should be in charge of making speaker selections. These should be forwarded to the President and VP, who will then approve them and set budgets for each speaker. The organizing council should also manage coffee and AV quotes.

3. Street team
	- Maybe someone who does Twitter well?
	- Website
	- Managing and reviews of travel awards
